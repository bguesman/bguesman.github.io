		  <h1 class="project-body">About Me</h1>
		  <p class="project-body">Hi, I'm Brad, and welcome to my portfolio page. If I was a 3D artist, this would probably be an Artstation. If I was a programmer, this would probably be a GitHub. If I was a musician, this would probably be a SoundCloud. But, things being the way they are, I do a lot of different things, so I decided it was a good idea to create a spot on the internet where I could put them all in one place. Here, you'll find projects that I've worked on, creative and technical, alone and with others, for fun and for more serious reasons.</p>

		  <p class="project-body">I'm 22 as of the time of writing this, so I've still got a lot to sort out before I know what to call myself. If I had to say something (and I do, this is my "about" page), I'd point to a Neal Stephenson book I read a few months ago. In it, there's a character who works at a game company, and his designation is just "weird stuff". All the problems that don't fit into one box—just a math problem, just a creative decision, just a code optimization—those are what he spends his days on. The kinds of problems that require you to see the big picture, but also to care about the details. To have the aesthetic-driven mindset of a creative, counter-balanced with the strong technical expertise of an engineer.</p>

			<p class="project-body">I'd consider myself lucky if that was the sort of job I got to wake up to 5 days a week. Even if I don't get to have "weird stuff" on my nameplate.</p>

			<p class="project-body">To cover the "hard technical skills" part of the equation, I double majored in Physics and Computer Science at Brown University in Rhode Island. While I was there, I spent a lot of time plunking away on GPUs in the Visual Computing department. So much time that eventually I was a teaching assistant for Brown's computer graphics course, and a researcher in the field of casual geometry and material capture ("how can you scan an object in real life and drop it into a virtual world with your iPhone?"). I was lucky enough to learn from and spend time with some of the most respected names in computer graphics, among them professors Andy Van Dam and John "Spike" Hughes.</p>

			<p class="project-body">My junior year, I was president of Brown's interdisciplinary club, "STEAM" (STEM + Art). I worked together with Brown and RISD students to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration through public workshops, discussions, and projects. I also ended up learning quite a bit about what it takes to lead a diverse team of writers, engineers, and artists from all sorts of different backgrounds.</p>

			<p class="project-body">While at Brown, I also released 3 EP's as the indie-electronic artist SN0WCRASH. My senior year, I played as many house shows as I could with my band Megafauna, and wrote much of my upcoming solo record (still untitled...). I love playing live music and meeting other musicians. Music is a special thing, and I have to credit it with getting me interested in creative work in the first place. There's nothing quite like screaming into a microphone until your vocal cords get so hoarse that not even a "homework beer" can make them feel better the next day.</p>

			<p class="project-body">I was fortunate enough to intern at a few cool places during my summers. At OurJamz (now out of business), I helped build a fully distributed audio engine for a web-based DAW. At Spansive (also now out of business), I worked on the wireless connectivity stack for the next generation of wireless chargers. And at Raven Software, I worked at the intersection of audio and computer graphics to solve a long-standing sound propagation problem in a new way for the game "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare".</p>

			<p class="project-body">Currently, I'm a software engineer at NVIDIA, working with a team of artists and engineers to create a believable but fully controllable virtual world for testing self-driving car algorithms. Stay tuned for updates on what specifically I do there—I start in two weeks!</p>

			<p class="project-body">Believe it or not, I do have other hobbies. You might find me baking sourdough or putting my health at risk tasting a fermentation project that's been out on the counter for a month. Some favorite games: Mass Effect, Outer Wilds, Breath of the Wild, The Witcher III. Some favorite books: Snow Crash, Slaughterhouse Five, Catcher in the Rye. I run because I like it, and I meditate because when you spend a lot of time in front of a screen, sometimes it's good to just sit for a little while.</p>

			<p class="project-body">If you want to chat about cool problems, swap ideas about any of the projects I've worked on, or just talk shop about guitar fuzz pedals, you can shoot me an email at brad.guesman@gmail.com.</p>

			<p class="project-body">For more formal things, here's a link to my <a target="_blank" href="resume.pdf">resume</a>, though I think you'll get a better sense of who I am just by reading this and fooling around on some of my project pages.</p>
