		<h2 class="project-body">A Classic Offline Rendering Algorithm</h1>

		<p class="project-body">The first project in Brown's CS2240 course, "Advanced Computer Graphics", was to implement a CPU path tracer, a renderer that models physically accurate light transport. The baseline requirements for the project were to implement a basic brute force path tracer that supports 4 kinds of BSDF's: Lambertian, Phong, perfect mirror, and refractive dielectric with Fresnel reflection.</p>

		<p class="project-body">Russian-Roulette path termination was a required feature, though it was left up to our discretion how to implement it. I chose to make the termination probability proportional to the square root of the norm of the BSDF, this way paths were more likely to terminate when bouncing off of surfaces that were minimally reflective. However, I had to play around with clamping it within a discrete range to avoid paths that bounce for too long and paths that don't bounce long enough. I ended up clamping it to the range [0.7, 0.9], which empirically produced the images with the least noise.</p>

		<p class="project-body">We were also required to implement direct lighting to reduce the noise in our image. All the images below were rendered with direct lighting, because without it the path tracer is almost unusable there's so much noise!</p>

		<p class="project-body">I also decided to implement a few extra features. I had initially intended to implement HDR's and some kind of simple denoising algorithm, but got caught up implementing other things instead. There was just too much cool stuff to do! I figured I would start by implementing features that would reduce the variance in my image (that weren't post-processing denoising algorithms), that way I could spend less time rendering tests. I implemented two features toward this end.</p>

		<p class="project-body">The first of these was "stratified sampling". This idea is simple: to get a more uniform sample of rays per pixel, divide the pixel into grid cells and sample rays through each grid cell to guarantee that the rays will roughly cover the whole pixel area. As much as I expected the differences to be noticeable, it seems that this sampling method is not really much of an improvement based on the image comparisons.</p>

		<p class="project-body">The second was "importance sampling". The idea here is to sample important BSDF directions more, and less important BSDF directions less. This reduces variance in the image. There is a huge difference in noise between the importance/non-importance sampled images, but it's particularly visible when rendering scenes that make use of the phong BRDF. This comparison is a testament to the fact that you really can't even render a clean image of a glossy object without some kind of importance sampling method.</p>

		<p class="project-body">I also tried my hand at implementing the Cook-Torrance BSDF, a microfacet model commonly used in PBR workflows (and the one used in Blender's Principled BSDF shader). I used the Beckmann distribution function. I wasn't able to get the importance sampler to work in time, which makes things tough.</p>

		<p class="project-body">The final extra feature I implemented was depth of fieldâ€”it's not so much a physically based model as a hack where I scatter the ray origins around the eye point within some radius (the "aperture") and then move the virtual film plane to where I want to place the focus plane.</p>

		<p class="project-body">I'd love to revisit this project in my free time and build out a more feature-complete path tracer, with more material models and more sophisticated samplers. I'd also like to implement something like metropolis light transport. Chances are good that when I do this again it will be a realtime GPU implementation.</p>
