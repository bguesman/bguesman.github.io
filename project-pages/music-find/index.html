			<h2 class="project-body">A Fun Way To Discover New Music</h1>

			<p class="project-body">Myself and <a href="https://www.davidschurman.com/">David Schurman</a> (a friend from Brown who is now co-founder of the wonderful <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudagronomics.com/">Cloud Agronomics</a>) were both frustrated with the lack of visual music discovery tools out there. After searching for a virtual "music map" of sorts, we were disappointed with the results. Most maps either only went one relational level deep or—even worse—were text based!</p>

			<div class="project-body-img-block">
				<div class="project-body-img-row">
					<div class="project-body-img-col">
						<img class="project-body-img" style="max-width:960px;" src="images/music-map.png"></img>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="project-body-caption">One of the existing music discovery maps. Boring!</p>
			</div>

			<p class="project-body">We realized that, in order for a related artists graph to be meaningful, two layers of depth are necessary, and relations between artists that are not the center artist have to be represented. This quite literally ties artists who are similar to each other together in the visualization.</p>
			<p class="project-body">This is particularly useful for seeing what different genres artists draw from. For instance, if you search "BØRNS" on Musicfind, you'll see two groups form. One has artists from the new wave (well, one definition of new wave) scene, like Hippo Campus, Bleachers and WALK THE MOON. Another is populated with female-dominant indie pop groups, like Banks, Broods, and Wet. These arguably represent two different important facets of BØRNS' musical style and influence.</p>
			<p class="project-body">It's been around two and a half years since I worked on this project, and due to the rapidly changing nature of web libraries, it is undergoing the modern digital equivalent of erosion. Please forgive any bugs you stumble upon!</p>

			<p class="project-body">This project lives on the web!
